# My first encounter with Linux;

When i was about 13 years old (ca. 2001), i got a Computer Magazine from a friend that had a bootable SuSE Linux LiveCD on it with (i think it was) KDE between 2.0 and 3.2. i messed around a little bit, but that was it, it was just a cool experience for someone who just knew Windows 95 and 98 at the time. 

# When it began;

Around 2005/2006 my begging for internet at home finally worked, and it didn't take long to find some chat rooms about computer stuff, which introduced me to Ubuntu 6.06. out of curiosity, i tried it first in a VM, which was annoying but fascinating at the same time. So to eliminate the annoying part, i installed Ubuntu 6.06 alongside Windows XP. 

It didn't take long for me to just use Ubuntu like every day and only booted Windows for gaming because Wine was really frustrating despite me getting some games to work.

But every time a system upgrade was available, xorg and the Nvidia drivers broke my Ubuntu installation. Every. Damn. Time.   
And every time i needed someone to help fix it for me because to date i never figured out myself, this was also frustrating.

# When it (almost) ended;

Speaking of frustration, when Ubuntu introduced Unity, i was on Ubuntu 10.04 with my beloved Gnome2, Compiz-Fusion and all the cool looking stuff which i liked the way it was. I tried Unity, didn't like it and used my 10.04 installation as long as i could ...until it broke again a few months later.  
  
I was so annoyed that i didn't even try to fix it and ditched Linux for a few years, using Windows 7 (and later Windows 10) without thinking about Linux at all.

# I came back;

Around 2015 i found my old Netbook (Asus EeePC 901) in the basement with Windows XP and Ubuntu Netbook Remix that i used from 2008 to 2009 at school. 

I asked on reddit about a more modern distro that runs on such a low hardware, which introduced me to Manjaro. (You can read about it \[here\](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/3dut5i/linux_on_asus_eeepc_901/), the post is still up!)

I knew about Arch Linux, but it was too much fiddling for me at the time.

I liked Manjaro and XFCE so much that i installed it on my main computer too. I even used it without Windows at all at some point (only because my Windows installation broke and i was too lazy to fix it, lol.). Which wasn't ideal because i was still playing a lot of games and Wine still annoyed me, but i got my most played games to work.

# A few years later;

Fast-forward to 2017, i got \[my first Thinkpad X230\](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/7h5imk/i_am_one_of_you_now/) and put Manjaro on it, ofc. I so much enjoyed the whole experience that i did all the non-gaming stuff on my Thinkpad while using my Computer only for gaming. 

That was until i lost my Thinkpad around 2022 at a time that couldn't be more bad because i just started retraining in IT and was planning on using it for educational purposes. I wasn't interested to install Manjaro on my computer and decided to just don't care about Linux for a while and focus on the retraining program.

# When it (almost) ended, again;

In the beginning of 2023 i got me a Thinkpad T480 because i was just half of the week in home office and the other half in the institution for my retraining and i couldn't use my cloud because the internet of the institution was soooo slow (which was ironic because the whole school was online with Microsoft Teams) and a USB-stick was also not a good option, because i had to synchronize multiple Windows VMs. So that's when the Thinkpad came in place.

I tried to install Arch Linux on it which broke my Windows installation over and over again and i was sad because i thought "archinstall" was the way for me to finally use Arch Linux instead of Manjaro but the partitioning-part is frustrating and confusing af. 

But i didn't wanted to go back to Manjaro, despite me fanboying about it for a long time, because i don't like how the devs decide what you (can't) use, like Grub Customizer as example. 

So in favor of the retraining i ditched the idea of using Linux, again.

# A new hope;

It's mid 2024, my retraining has ended and the idea of using Arch Linux is still stuck in my head all the time. A week ago i tried Arch Linux again in a VM, got it installed (easy when using archinstall and there is no Windows involved) and figured most of the things out to the point i was hopeful enough to try installing it on my Thinkpad alongside Windows again.  
  
And it worked! Shrunk about 120GiB from my Windows partition, set the partitions up and did the rest with archinstall and here i am, using Arch Linux on my Thinkpad!

I am so glad that i tried it again and got it finally working, now i have to change like everything to my likings, but that's the fun part, right?

  
...I hope it will last a long time.
